# d6t-grove-arduino
This library is for evaluating Omron sensor D6T with Arduino UNO.  

D6T is an infrared sensor that can measure the surface temperature of an object noncontactly by receiving radiant heat energy from the object with a thermopile element.
It can be used as a highly sensitive human sensor that can also detect stationary people.
